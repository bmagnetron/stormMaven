RUN INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

storm jar C:\storm111\LifeRay.jar com.storm.url.stream.spring.UrlTopologyRun

UI- TOPOLOGY REGISTRATION
------------------------------
The Localcluster does not support topology UI.
If you really want to see the topology with a single machine, you can build the single node cluster, 
which you should run one zookeeper, one storm nimbus and one storm ui thread on the same machine. 
To submit your topology to the cluster you should use StormSubmitter and change your code 

LocalCluster cluster = new LocalCluster(); to following.

if (args != null && args.length > 0) {
  conf.setNumWorkers(3);

  StormSubmitter.submitTopology(args[0], conf, builder.createTopology());
}
else {

  LocalCluster cluster = new LocalCluster();
  cluster.submitTopology("test", conf, builder.createTopology());
  Utils.sleep(10000);
  cluster.killTopology("test");
  cluster.shutdown();
}
The code indicates when you add args, it will send the topology to the cluster, otherwise, it will run it locally.

And make sure you have import StormSubmitter with import backtype.storm.StormSubmitter;
